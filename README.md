## Self-Evaluation: 
(For this assignment, there was 22 exercises checked by 68 automated checks)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment:
I think I deserve a 10/20 on this assignment. While I went through and attempted to complete all of the checks, only half of them passed after 7 passes of changes. I am very interested to see the solution code for this assignment so that I understand what went wrong with mine, since many of the failed checks I thought I had the syntax correct for. I plan on having this grade dropped as my lowest assignment grade, but I still will learn from my mistakes. 
## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting -->
There were many good takeaways in terms of what is possible with the different functions. I thought the thing that was most interesting that you can take an array and convert that into a string and also take a string to convert that into an array. 
### How long it took you to finish this?
It took many hours for me to complete this as I was at first confused by the amount of failed checks, and upon seeing the checks it looked like they were occurring in the "_tests_" files, so I started to try and edit those first before realizing I should have been editing the other files. Afterwards, I had lots of trouble fixing the failed tests in all the files.
